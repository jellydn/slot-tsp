# Optional SwanStation comparison core — offline integration gate

PCSX ReARMed remains the PS1 default. SwanStation is an explicit per-game
choice (`swanstation` in `Config/selected_core.txt`). It is not a replacement,
release dependency, or claim of higher speed or handheld compatibility.

## Source and licence boundary

Upstream: <https://github.com/libretro/swanstation>, revision
`631f0fb31b809e0f889d7c551fe695788e39c1d3`.
The local checkout used for the prior build is
`/tmp/amp-librarian/libretro_swanstation`; its working tree was clean when
checked. The exported build tree and output are under
`.amp/in/ps1-alternative/swan-build/`.

SwanStation supplies the GNU GPL version 3 in `LICENSE`. Keep that licence,
all source copyright notices and the complete corresponding build source.
Do not label the entire dependency tree GPL-only: preserve the separate
notices for `dep/libchdr` and its compression libraries, `dep/libretro-common`,
`dep/openbios`, `dep/vixl`, `dep/glad`, `dep/stb`, `dep/xxhash`,
`dep/vulkan-loader`, and any other compiled or redistributed dependencies.
The Makefile uses VIXL on AArch64; the presence of a dependency directory alone
does not prove it was linked. Preserve the exact dependency sources and build
flags rather than infer attribution from a single umbrella licence.

The optional package inputs retain the pinned source, licences, build recipe,
toolchain identity and per-file source manifest beside the runtime. Candidate
readiness is recorded in its verification receipts, separately from hardware acceptance.
No Sony BIOS or game is supplied. A user-supplied BIOS remains the user's
responsibility; authored contract fixtures are not BIOS boot evidence.

### Licensed embedded replacement firmware

This revision contains the MIT-licensed PCSX-Redux OpenBIOS binary and generated
C++ array under `dep/openbios/`. `src/core/system.cpp` includes
`openbios.bin.h` and calls `Bus::SetBIOS(openbios, sizeof(openbios))` when
no external BIOS image was found. This is not a Sony BIOS or user file, but it
is BIOS code embedded in the core. Omitting just `openbios.bin` from a source
archive does not remove the compiled firmware or the generated header.

The package excludes user/proprietary game ROMs, Sony BIOS and user data.
The upstream replacement firmware has a separate MIT licence; no specific
owner approval of OpenBIOS is claimed. Preserve `dep/openbios/LICENSE.txt`
(MIT, copyright 2019
PCSX-Redux authors), the binary, generated header and conversion/build files.
The complete pinned upstream tree is retained without dependency substitutions.
Existing test.7 source snapshots and payloads are not modified; test.8 remains
local and hardware-unverified.

Independent identity checks (hash the complete bytes, not display strings):

| Input | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `git archive --format=tar 631f0fb31b809e0f889d7c551fe695788e39c1d3` | `f5ead949860a003e928e581c4a2b154574d91672350f2887d152985cb122bb68` |
| `dep/openbios/openbios.bin` (524288 bytes) | `0a9685d9895b422f091a9bcceed8f73cf67a414c09eb8310c714f27ccdfdb349` |
| `dep/openbios/openbios.bin.h` | `bef0f79598bd867fb310d4acfbbbfcacf6c316aecb803a9ee062d0547e5aa0ed` |

The raw unfiltered Git tar is 113612800 bytes and includes upstream firmware.
It includes tracked vendored dependencies; this revision has no Git submodules.
Recompute from a separately obtained pinned checkout with:

```sh
git archive --format=tar 631f0fb31b809e0f889d7c551fe695788e39c1d3 | shasum -a 256
shasum -a 256 dep/openbios/openbios.bin dep/openbios/openbios.bin.h
shasum -a 256 /path/to/swanstation_libretro.so
```

For the parent's final package command, add both optional arguments:

```sh
--swan-source /tmp/amp-librarian/libretro_swanstation \
--swan-core .amp/in/ps1-alternative/swan-build/swanstation_libretro.so
```

The recipe rejects an unreviewed source/runtime hash before it writes output.
It archives only pinned Git content, not dirty/untracked checkout files, user
BIOS or saves. The output includes `Sources/swanstation-source.tar.gz`,
`Sources/SWANSTATION-MANIFEST.json`, extracted licence texts and runtime metadata.
`BUILD-INFO.json` records the compressed source archive hash, original Git tar
hash, runtime hash, embedded firmware and the state-support limitation. The
outer package manifest also covers those files. Omitting both arguments leaves
Swan out of the package; PCSX is default in either case.

## Prior build evidence and recipe

The prior build used offline Docker image
`rust@sha256:4730e387a220a08a365c77da3096544dde214f9d796c16284d4be45438cad4a9`
on `linux/arm64`, with no network and a read-only source mount. The command was:

```sh
CFLAGS="-mcpu=cortex-a53" CXXFLAGS="-mcpu=cortex-a53" \
  make -f Makefile.libretro platform=unix CPU_ARCH=aarch64 -j4
```

The exact wrapper is `.amp/in/ps1-alternative/build-probe.sh`; its ELF/version
report is `.amp/in/ps1-alternative/build.log`. The existing
`swan-build/swanstation_libretro.so` SHA-256 is
`3b5d66f649aa1a1d53feaf102a14d6787ae337f758199d89cfd42ba0f9da94a8`.
That report identifies AArch64 and a maximum GLIBC requirement of 2.29.
This is build/ABI evidence, not successful device loading or frame timing.
For a repeat, export the pinned full source/dependencies into a new disposable
directory and use the wrapper's same offline image and flags. Never clean or
overwrite the existing evidence tree. Installation is owner-controlled:
`System/swanstation_libretro.so` on Linux (host extension differs).

## Runtime policy and unresolved decision

The frontend presets the software renderer before `retro_init`, native 1x
resolution, PGXP off, card 1 `Libretro`, and card 2 `None`. No hardware context
or new rendering backend is introduced. In upstream
`src/libretro/libretro_host_interface.cpp`, `RequestHardwareRendererContext`
returns without a hardware request for `Software`.

**Swan save states and resume are disabled.** Upstream
`src/core/pad.cpp::DoStateMemcard` reads card contents from a snapshot into the
live card. That can roll back a newer card even with separate save directories.
The owner approved comparison-only operation with states, quick states and
automatic resume disabled; no card reconciliation is part of this milestone.
Do not silently restore an old card or copy a PCSX state. Enabling states later
would require a separate decision and validation.

Cards use `Saves/PS/<core>/<SHA256(game-stem)>/memory.sav`. The same per-core,
per-game directory is supplied to the core as its save directory. Existing PCSX
paths stay unchanged. There is no automatic import, copy, fallback, or migration
between cores. The state ring remains `States/PS/<core>/<game-stem>/` for both
manual and resume paths; those paths do not imply Swan state support is enabled.

The authored C fixture checks pre-init options, save directory, native
software-frame transport, card memory, refusal of states and unchanged card
bytes after refusal. Real-core acceptance uses the original MIPS program
`acceptance.S`, built by `build-acceptance.py` into two MODE2 discs and an M3U.
No SDK, proprietary game, external BIOS or network is needed for these checks.

### Latest offline acceptance

The unchanged pinned Swan runtime passes authored boot, RIGHT-controlled
red/green output, game-generated audio with silence on release, disc reads
0→1→0 with distinct data on each disc, and a checked card counter across three
core reopen cycles. These are emulated-game assertions, not firmware frame or
audio-callback counts. The source's RGB555→RGB565 conversion yields green 251;
the colour assertion permits one quantisation step, but not the wrong colour.
The audio gate observed 44234 held samples with absolute energy 379946594,
versus zero energy while idle and after release.

The frontend now selects the core-advertised DualShock subclass: Swan uses 261,
whereas PCSX uses 517. A contract regression advertises both an analog joystick
and DualShock to catch accidental use of the wrong device. PCSX remains default.

Real Slot worker boot/exit/restart also passes: the authored counter advances
to 4 then 5 across two full sessions, with the PCSX sentinel unchanged. Quick
Save, Quick Load and resume attempts produce no Swan state files. Log:
`.amp/in/ps1-alternative/authored-slot-lifecycle.log`.
Earlier failures below are historical evidence, not the current boot result.
The combined gate also requires broad regressions, a rebuilt executable and
independent package/source verification; see the candidate's receipts.
No SD or handheld action is part of this offline work. No commercial-game,
hardware compatibility, analog-stick coverage or speed conclusion follows.

## Historical failed boot gate and fixture diagnosis

`crates/slot/tests/native_software.rs` now provides an ignored, explicit real-core
gate, `swan_authored_disc_must_execute_gameplay_not_only_firmware_frames`.
It uses Slot's actual core loader, presets and state capability gate, the pinned
AArch64 runtime, the existing authored CUE/BIN and no proprietary/user BIOS.
It requires sustained authored red gameplay and the emulated card-write byte;
firmware frames or audio callbacks cannot satisfy the gameplay assertion.

The offline Linux ARM64 run failed: after 1200 frames the geometry was 640x448,
there were zero authored red frames and 1769340 audio samples. The card-write
assertion was not reached. This is a retained failing acceptance gate, not a
passing regression test. Log: `.amp/in/ps1-alternative/slot-real-boot-gate.log`.

Direct libretro controls also failed with the existing disc, a GPU-only disc,
and a GPU-only standalone EXE. The standalone EXE's instructions were present
in RAM, but no red frame appeared with either recompiler or interpreter. The
original CUE control produced 1197 software frames from 1200 calls and zero
hardware-context requests. An inspected capture was black. Nonzero audio
samples do not prove game audio because firmware can produce sound.

A separately generated ISO/MODE1 control failed its file lookup (invalid seek)
and is not counted as valid disc-boot evidence. Do not attribute all failures to
that control: the original MODE2 CUE and standalone EXE fail independently.
The precise OpenBIOS/core boot cause is not established; no speculative firmware,
renderer, BIOS patch or default change has been applied. Relevant direct logs
are `real-cue-v2.log`, `real-minimized.log` and `real-full-iso-interpreter.log`.

Real gameplay/input/game-audio/disc-switch/card-persistence acceptance remains
incomplete. The owner authorised SD update only after all milestones pass and
explicitly ruled out substituting the partial test.8 package. Therefore no new
combined Swan package, SD identification/write/eject operation or live profiling
was performed. The frozen PICO-label/PS1-rewind test.8 candidate is unchanged.

### Offline follow-up: disc boot reached; card acceptance still blocked

The original authored ISO omitted both ISO9660 path tables and the volume-set
and volume-sequence fields. PCSX HLE tolerated this. A separate diagnostic Swan
build exposed OpenBIOS's terminal `Unimplemented A0:A1` / `halting` output.
Instruction tracing with the corrected path tables reached `0x80010000` and
executed the authored instructions. This establishes a fixture defect, not a
production Swan renderer or CPU fix. `crates/slot-retro/tests/software.rs` now
generates the missing fields and little-/big-endian root path tables in sectors
18/19; the original program, assertions and core runtime are unchanged.

Controls through Slot's real loader, using the **unchanged baseline** Swan:

- Corrected disc with original card code: still zero red frames after 1200
  frames. The diagnostic interpreter reaches the game's BIOS card-open call
  after `InitCARD`; it does not reach the drawing code. Whether the fixture
  needs a fuller asynchronous card initialisation sequence or OpenBIOS lacks
  the required behavior is not established.
- Corrected disc with just the first 42 card-instruction words replaced by
  NOPs: ten authored red frames at 320x224. The unchanged acceptance test then
  correctly fails the card assertion (255 versus 1). This is disc boot and
  GPU execution evidence only, not card/input/game-audio acceptance.
- The bounded PCSX ARM64 core passes the original authored MIPS/card/state/
  multidisc test with the corrected fixture. The generated raw disc SHA-256
  matches the independent corrected control:
  `54cd91ea98746dcb041f90d50d14e72780515a5f6af87481a4d048ae1ecf5614`.
  The GPU-only control hash is
  `e22c3d92ad610a8008166c29c93e2e873d3edc41fde296714194b94c015d098b`.

Logs under `.amp/in/ps1-alternative/`: `trace-original-disc.log`,
`trace-path-table.log`, `baseline-complete-card.log`,
`baseline-complete-gpu.log`, and `fixture-arm-bounded-check.log`.
Do not interpret the earlier standalone EXE failure as disproving this disc
result: its upstream boot path applies a separate fixed-address BIOS patch.
No BIOS patch or replacement was made in this follow-up.

The missing card startup was resolved by adding `StartCARD` after `InitCARD`
while retaining BIOS interrupts. CREATE is not open-or-create on OpenBIOS;
the new acceptance program opens existing files first. An additional disc-test
defect called unimplemented B0:40 instead of CD-driver A0:64. Correcting those
fixture calls, not changing the emulator, produced the latest passing results.
Logs: `card-marker-gate.log`, `authored-pad-trace.log` (historical strict-colour
failure), and `authored-full-v2.log` under `.amp/in/ps1-alternative/`.
Baseline Swan and frozen test.8 hashes remain unchanged. Diagnostic
instrumentation is not a candidate runtime and is removed from the frontend.

## Owner-controlled same-scene A/B plan (not executed)

1. Back up the content root and record hashes. Use disposable copies only.
   Give each core an independent empty card; never reuse original cards/states.
2. Record exact frontend/core hashes, options, BIOS/disc hashes, display mode,
   power/clock/temperature settings and test scene/input sequence.
3. Start each core clean, reach the same scene through the same inputs or an
   independently created in-game save. Do not exchange emulator states.
4. Run PCSX/Swan/Swan/PCSX with equal warm-up and duration. Record frame-time
   distribution, sustained speed, audio faults, visual faults and temperature
   only after the owner authorises profiling on the target device.
5. Verify separate cards survive exit/reopen and PCSX hashes are unchanged by
   Swan runs. Reject missing-core, unsupported-content or save-read errors;
   never present a fallback run as Swan evidence.
6. Report results for that scene/device only. No general faster claim or
   release/default change follows from this experiment.

## Opt-in host offscreen hardware prototype

`crates/slot-gfx/examples/swan-hw-probe.rs` is an opt-in diagnostic behind
`slot-gfx/host-hw-probe`: desktop GL on macOS, offscreen EGL/GLES on Linux.
It is not linked into normal gameplay. The
`slot-retro/host-probe` feature exposes the existing raw ABI to the diagnostic;
it does not enable hardware rendering in `LibretroCore`. Production PCSX NEON,
Swan software selection, per-core cards and disabled Swan states/resume remain
unchanged. The example never invokes a state API or accepts a user save root.

The Mac probe owns a CGL desktop OpenGL 4.1 context and RGBA8 FBO on one thread.
It accepts only desktop core GL 3.2/3.3 requests without frontend depth/stencil,
supplies proc/FBO callbacks, resets the core with that context current, and
reads bounded native-resolution frames into top-left RGBA bytes. NULL means
duplicate; the hardware sentinel is never dereferenced. Dimensions above
1024×512 and readback failures are errors. Every fresh hardware-run frame must
use the hardware callback; software fallback fails the run. RGB555 conversion
differences of at most four channel values are allowed when comparing complete
software/hardware images, not merely a screenshot centre pixel.

The real-GL marker test checks asymmetric corners, both origin conventions,
padded pixel-pack state, bounds and target sizes 7×5, 320×224, 320×448 and 3×9.
The authored-disc CLI checks idle/red, RIGHT/green with game audio, release/red
with silence, and CROSS-triggered yellow/blue/yellow disc reads. It closes and
reopens software, OpenGL and OpenGL contexts. Its own new card is fsynced,
reopened and byte-compared after each core closes; the game counter must be
1, 2, 3. This is a disposable authored card, not user-card migration.

One prototype lifecycle defect was reproduced and fixed: calling context
destroy after `retro_unload_game` crashed in `System::RecreateGPU` because
Swan's destroy callback switches to software through the still-live GPU.
Destroy is now called while the game exists, then unload/deinit, then owned
FBO/context/library destruction. Repeated complete core lifecycles pass.
The first disc probe also sent Circle rather than CROSS; it failed red rather
than yellow. The probe now uses the existing `ButtonMask::B` mapping, confirmed
against pinned Swan source. Neither fix changes the upstream core.

### Reproduce on a host, without SD/device access

Use the pinned complete Swan source above. In a fresh export, the Mac build is:

```sh
make -f Makefile.libretro platform=osx arch=arm64 CPU_ARCH=aarch64 \
  CC=clang CXX=clang++ GIT_VERSION=631f0fb \
  GIT_HASH=631f0fb31b809e0f889d7c551fe695788e39c1d3 -j4
```

The reviewed local Mac build used Apple clang 21.0.0 on arm64 Darwin 27.2.0.
Its SHA256 is
`d036a49fa80836d9a8b65b02544c27c879deafa262cc1a8865f0fab5d1ae4d98`.
This diagnostic runtime is not an approved distributable and does not replace
the preserved Linux runtime. It retains upstream licensed MIT OpenBIOS.

From the Slot root (choose new output directories; the commands refuse reuse):

```sh
python3 cores/ps1-pico8/build-acceptance.py /tmp/slot-authored-hw \
  --llvm-bin /opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin
cargo +1.96 test -p slot-gfx --no-default-features --features host-hw-probe \
  --example swan-hw-probe --offline --locked
cargo +1.96 run --release -p slot-gfx --no-default-features \
  --features host-hw-probe --example swan-hw-probe --offline --locked -- \
  /absolute/path/swanstation_libretro.dylib \
  /tmp/slot-authored-hw/authored.m3u /tmp/slot-hw-results
```

The rebuilt fixture's `SHA256.json` exactly matched the retained acceptance
fixture. Runs emit authored PNGs, three diagnostic cards and `report.json` with
GL identity, frame counts, audio sample/energy counts and timed 180-frame
windows. Readback time includes GPU synchronisation, allocation and CPU
orientation/alpha normalisation. Core wall time also includes the software
frame-copy path in software mode. PNG writes are outside timed windows.

### Linux GLES diagnostic and executed stock gate

The same authored assertions now compile for AArch64 Linux. The example's
private `egl.rs` loads installed EGL/GLES dynamically, requests ES3.2 and a
64×64 RGBA8 pbuffer, owns the context/FBO on one thread, and refuses unsupported
offscreen operation. It has no native-window creation or swap function and
does not change `FbdevSurface`. A 300-second process alarm precedes driver/core
loading. Normal teardown destroys core GL resources before unloading the game,
then the owned FBO/context; failed EGL cleanup fails the diagnostic. Failed
game loads do not call Swan's destroy callback on a nonexistent GPU.

The output must be new. On Linux it also becomes `TMPDIR`, keeping temporary
BIOS, shader-cache and save roots inside the diagnostic output. Only the
authored test card is carried through the three independent lifecycles. No
state API, user save directory or audio-device output is used. Linux reports
compatibility/frame/audio counts, not the Mac's timing measurements. An alarm
or crash does not run Rust destructors: the separately approved execution
wrapper must still collect available host evidence and remove only its newly
created temporary directory. Core-generated files remain within that root.

Host cross-build uses Rust 1.96 and Zig 0.17.1. For example, set Cargo's
`CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER` to an executable shell wrapper
containing `exec zig cc -target aarch64-linux-gnu.2.29 "$@"`, then run:

```sh
cargo +1.96 build --release --offline --locked -p slot-gfx \
  --no-default-features --features host-hw-probe --example swan-hw-probe \
  --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

The prepared executable is ELF64 AArch64 with maximum GLIBC symbol requirement
2.28, linked to libc, libpthread and libdl (no bundled vendor graphics driver).
Compilation is not stock shader/core acceptance. Do not run the command's
output on a target without specific approval.

Fresh publication checks passed: 170 gfx/retro tests (five external tests stay
ignored), the real-GL marker test, strict Mac and AArch64 Linux diagnostic
Clippy, formatting and Linux release cross-build. The full Mac authored run
again passed card counters 1/2/3 and 2787 hardware callbacks for all 2787 fresh
frames in each hardware lifecycle. A missing authored disc failed the card
acceptance gate rather than being accepted for producing firmware frames.
Receipts: `.amp/in/swan-hw-probe/pr5-{baseline,mac,clippy,linux-clippy,run}.log`,
`linux-build.log`, `linux-elf.txt`. The fresh Mac report SHA256 is
`591a1558060fe891dc995d62bb08ce815af1109826d76774a4f0a11dc153d3fd`.
Prepared Linux executable SHA256 is
`1a192596bffd2214f679eb14630057961bdc7b907684c384793d187866b72eb7`.
No actual Linux driver/core run is implied by these host checks.

The owner separately approved and consumed this exact target scope: refuse an existing
`/tmp/slot-swan-gles-20261107/`; copy only the reviewed executable, unchanged
pinned Swan runtime and generated `authored.m3u`, `first.cue/.bin`,
`second.cue/.bin` plus hash manifest. Run one diagnostic process from that root,
with new output there, through Software → GLES → GLES. Check actual hardware
callbacks, full captured image comparison, input-controlled sound samples and
silence, real disc reads and card counters 1/2/3. Read back evidence to the host,
then remove only the created root and independently verify absence. No user
games/BIOS/cards, SD, settings/services, presentation, physical input, sound
output, power changes or performance benchmark. Fresh unique stock identity
and input hashes were checked. Both the earlier capability approval and this
one core-test approval are consumed; neither authorises another execution.

#### Stock Swan GLES result — compatibility passes, not speed acceptance

On 7 November 2026, exactly one 300-second-alarmed process completed
Software → GLES → GLES with exit 0, using the reviewed executable and unchanged
pinned Swan runtime. Fresh unique target identity matched TinaLinux 4.9.191
#899, Neptune `5C1C9C53`, `a133-aw3/generic v1.0`, firmware `1.1.1` and the
four installed graphics-library hashes from the capability check. The actual
context reported Imagination / PowerVR Rogue GE8300 / GLES 3.2 build
`1.19@6345021`. The target root was new; HOME, TMPDIR and cache/output roots
were confined to that disposable directory.

- All three lifecycles produced 2787 fresh 320×224 frames. Each hardware
  lifecycle used hardware callbacks for all 2787; no software fallback passed.
- All six authored states passed: red idle, green RIGHT with nonzero generated
  audio energy, red/silent release, and yellow/blue/yellow disc 0→1→0 reads.
  Whole readback images matched software within the documented ≤4/channel
  quantisation tolerance. This exercises the fixture's shaders, not every
  Swan shader variant or a commercial game.
- Each disposable 128 KiB card was fsynced/reopened and passed the counter
  assertion 1/2/3 across core lifecycles. No state API or user card was used.
- Detach, context destruction, surface destruction and EGL termination all
  reported success for every lifecycle. The alarm did not end the process.
- Independent host readback matched all eight input and 22 output hashes,
  decoded/compared all 18 PNGs, checked the three cards and rechecked report
  counts/audio assertions. Final hardware idle/RIGHT/disc-0/disc-1 captures
  were visually inspected. Only the created target root was removed; a
  separate later ADB query confirmed both directory and symlink absence.

Report SHA256:
`00c41fd013c4e0c433aaffeec9d1df6c9fe6f06a4a05207eecf04b072f5113fb`.
Streamed runtime log SHA256:
`a8344664ca538578866c08e282c54051e9c589c53671b899a7f44df7d8ffcefe`.
Private receipts and readbacks remain under
`.amp/in/stock-swan-gles-20261107/`, including `verification.txt` and
`cleanup-independent.txt`. No user games/BIOS/cards/settings/SD/services were
accessed; no window/swap, physical input, sound-device output, performance
benchmark or production renderer ran. No graphics driver was distributed.

### Executed stock capability gate — not Swan core acceptance

`egl-capability.c` preserves the exact original source of the separately
approved one-process stock probe. Cross-build with
`zig cc -target aarch64-linux-gnu.2.29 -O2 -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror egl-capability.c -ldl -o probe`.
Its source SHA256 is
`2c3c914c26cfde120fa29e11b34deac08de905f42c9e61ace029dc189dd85bd2`;
reviewed executable SHA256 is
`ad64f390001695400437030795b48095d1fe2c4398769f1642e4e5a208e33f18`.
Fresh identity showed TinaLinux 4.9.191 #899, Neptune `5C1C9C53`,
`a133-aw3/generic v1.0`, firmware version `1.1.1`. This is connected-userspace
evidence, not independent authentication of an unmodified firmware image.

The approved execution returned EGL 1.4 and **GLES 3.2 / GLSL 3.20**, GE8300,
Imagination build `1.19@6345021`, using its own 64×64 pbuffer. The 4×4
RGBA8/depth32F FBO was complete (`0x8cd5`), all 16 asymmetric RGBA pixels matched
and all GL errors were zero. Normal resource/context/surface/EGL cleanup passed;
process and ADB exits were zero. The ten-second alarm did not fire. The shell
removed the created binary/directory, and a separate read-only query confirmed
absence. No game/core or display window/swap ran; the SD was untouched.

Maximum texture/renderbuffer size was 8192, colour attachments/draw buffers 8,
samples 4. Runtime extension advertisements include EGL image/fence/wait and
surfaceless support and GL float colour buffers/copy-image/buffer storage.
They are not proof of working shared-context texture/fence transport. The
readback checks colour, not arbitrary shader or depth-test correctness.
The streamed runtime receipt SHA256 is
`ba1e86e36838eac2959c263d696369bf522b148f79733c50359ab4f298981791`.
Private receipts are `.amp/in/stock-gpu-capability-20261107/`; proprietary
driver copies are never committed or packaged.

### Cost and remaining gates

The Apple M2 Pro/OpenGL 4.1 host passes the authored software/hardware checks.
On this simple fill-scene fixture, hardware plus CPU readback is slower than
software; this is not a demanding-game benchmark or target speed estimate.
For idle/RIGHT/release, final run 7 measured 0.92–1.09 ms per software core step
versus 1.40–1.48 ms for OpenGL plus readback. The readback/normalisation section
alone took 0.68–0.73 ms per step. These are unpaced, release-build host windows
of 180 calls each, not TSP frame times. All 2787 fresh frames in each hardware
lifecycle used hardware transport; full captured images matched software
within the stated quantisation tolerance. The authored card counters were
1, 2, 3. The real-GL test, 170 baseline gfx/retro tests (five additional tests
ignored), strict prototype Clippy and changed-file rustfmt passed. This is not
an all-green workspace claim. No JS/TS source changed.

Receipts are under `.amp/in/swan-hw-probe/`. Final `run-7/report.json` SHA256:

No upload/compositor/presentation/audio-device cost is measured: this diagnostic
does not run Slot's worker/menu path.

The basic stock Tina GLES3/pbuffer/RGBA8/depth32F gate and Swan's authored
offscreen GLES lifecycles now pass. Other shader/content paths, context loss,
worker/compositor integration, presentation, sound-device behaviour, sustained
target timing and thermal behaviour remain unverified.
The saved ES3.2 GE8300 report is from **KNULLI**, not stock Tina. Do not use it
as stock acceptance. PCSX's separate GLES1 plugin still needs a distinct port;
this Swan diagnostic does not make both cores hardware-capable. Shared-texture
transport/fences or a production renderer require another architecture decision.
Production feasibility: a worker-owned offscreen context and bounded CPU
readback can retain the current frame contract, but does not establish a speed
win. The next decision is whether to integrate that opt-in readback path or
approve a shared-texture/fence design. The latter needs
new frame ownership, synchronisation, resize/context-loss and compositor
compatibility contracts; do not implement it as an implicit option toggle.
No new package, SD update or default-core change follows from this diagnostic.
The owner authorises branch publication and a verified combined prerelease when
ready; unfinished compatibility/integration work must remain explicit blockers.
